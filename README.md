# Sillén
1. `acid.py`: A Python module that defines the `Acid` class for modeling equlibirum behaviour of polyprotic acids.

2. `sillen_diagram.py`: A Python script that uses the `Acid` class to generate Sillén diagrams for acids with n dissociable protons based on their pKa values and initial concentrations.

3. `use_sillen.ipynb`: Open this in a Jupyter environment (or on (MyBinder)[https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/janjoch/sillen/HEAD?labpath=use_sillen.ipynb] to start plotting immediately.)
